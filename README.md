# Project: Delivery Route Optimization

![Delivery Route Network](img/delivery-route-network.jpg)

This project is a **Delivery Route Optimization** tool built using Streamlit. It aims to optimize delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles while considering constraints such as delivery time windows, vehicle capacity, and traffic conditions.


### Key Features
1. **Route Optimization**:
   - Solve the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles.
   - Incorporate constraints like:
     - Delivery time windows.
     - Vehicle capacity.
     - Traffic conditions.

2. **Map Visualization**:
   - Display optimized routes on an interactive map using **Folium**.
   - Highlight delivery stops, start and end points, and route distances.

3. **Calendar View**:
   - Provide a calendar-based schedule for deliveries.
   - Allow users to view and manage delivery schedules for specific days or weeks.

4. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Enable real-time updates for route changes due to unexpected events (e.g., traffic congestion, vehicle breakdowns).
   - Re-optimize routes dynamically and update the map and calendar views.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language for optimization and application logic.
- **Google OR-Tools**: Solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with constraints.
- **Streamlit**: Build an interactive web application for route visualization and schedule management.
- **Folium**: Create interactive maps for route visualization.
- **Synthetic Data**: Integrate real-time traffic data for dynamic route adjustments.

## Deployment

This application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces and is accessible at:

ðŸš€ [Delivery Route Optimization App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jing997/DeliveryRouteOptimisation)

The deployed version provides all the features of the local application without requiring any installation. You can:

- View and analyze optimized delivery routes
- Interact with the map visualization
- Explore the calendar view of scheduled deliveries
- Test different optimization parameters
- Filter deliveries by date, status, and priority

The app is automatically updated whenever changes are pushed to the connected GitHub repository.
